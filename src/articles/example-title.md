# How Do Modern Celebs Use Their Power To Their Advantage? Why?

Since the beginning of social media, there has been at least 1 person that
dominates overall, whether it be a model, an artist or even a Youtuber, the
internet has always been some level of popularity contest. Way back when
Instagram was a young and fresh app, Selena Gomez was taking the stage with her
whopping 217 million followers. With that comes a lot of power, with a fanbase
that passes the population of Russia, if Selena made a claim or said something
online, those hundreds of millions of people would follow her lead. Such
examples would include presidential votes. If a celeb posted on their media of
choice about how they voted for candidate an instead of candidate b, all of
those followers, hungry for attention and recognition would choose similarly. In
an article posted in June of 2014 by Valerie R O’Regan titled, “The Celebrity
Influence: Do people really care what they think?”, the article talks about the
major influence on the general population when exposed to a celebrity's opinion.
An excerpt of the article is as follows “Celebrity opinions and endorsements of
political candidates, issues and office holders have now become commonplace in
the media before and between elections. Many actors and comedians, athletes and
talk-show hosts share their opinions with society in an attempt to influence the
opinions of those who listen to them. Often these celebrities use their
influence to persuade citizens to vote a certain way or advocate for certain
issues such as reproductive freedom, environmental protection and human rights.
This study examines young adults’ perceptions about celebrities’ political
opinions and endorsements. The research finds that young adults are more likely
to listen to individuals other than celebrities for their own political
information. However, they do believe that celebrities have an effect on the way
people think. mkkkkkk

# How Is This Being Used In Real Life?

## And Why?

Popular news and online reporter Daniel “Killer Keemstar” Keem has mentioned
this in some recent videos, where certain youtube and twitch celebrities are
using their influence on others to sway public opinion. The closest and simplest
example is stock

influences, recently; “DOGECOIN” which is an online currency aimed at the stock
market. CEO of Tesla, PayPal; and SpaceX, Elon Musk has been using his
popularity on Twitter to coax people into purchasing stocks of DOGECOIN
therefore raising its price. Which in turn makes Elon more money whenever he
sells the stocks at the highest price. In this case, it can be assumed that the
sole reason for Elon Musk’s Twitter posts was to make him the most possible
money via stocks. In an article titled, “Tweets from Elon Musk and other
celebrities send dogecoin to a record high” by Ryan Browne, Browne states the
following key points; “

- Dogecoin rallied 37% in 24 hours to a record high of $0.084945 on Monday,
  according to data from CoinMarketCap.
- Dogecoin, based on the “doge” meme, was initially started as a joke but has
  since gained a following.
- Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg and Gene Simmons have tweeted about the cryptocurrency
  recently.”

These points directly correlate to the use of DOGECOIN references in Elon musk
and other popular celebrities twitter posts such as;
