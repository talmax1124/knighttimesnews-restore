# *What are Griffins*

#### *Story*

You're climbing up a mountain, you're close to the top almost they're after 4 hours of climbing up the mountain, you reach the top finding the highest point, you never felt more prouder in your own skills. They you see something fly down upon you, the size was big so you run down the mountain turning around but slipped on your own footing going tumbling down when you stop your eyes hit the rocks in from of your head your blind, screaming trying to get help than you hear the wind whoosh down upon you the beast is in front you can’t run your injuries are too bad to be strong enough to make a run for it, you wait praying for it to leave you alone or make what's about to happen next quick. It breathes on your faces and then a trail of a wet substance covers your eyes but instead of more pain it's all gone. You open your eyes to find an eagle being the one to lick you but when you look to the sides of the eagle the body was of a lion it pointed to an area down the mountain, it was the trail to go back down the mountain to homesite it was then I look back to hear another whoosh the beast was gone but I was safe, when I went back to the home site the workers didn't believe me but I did the monster I thought was to be the end of me saved me.

#### *Background*

A griffin/gryphon is a chimeric creature, said to be part eagle and part lion. With incredible strength, unfailing protective instincts these noble animals are said to have no tolerance for evil, being of both good fate and will (*writers note: how much for a heart of gold/ it should be heart of a griffin*). The griffin was first founded in Egypt and Iran being just sculptures the news of the creature was said to have been spread among the world by historians, them stating about its magnificent and power. The griffin has the strengths of both an eagle and a lion. Its head is of an eagle, body of a lion, with wings to its sides, being able to lift itself off the ground. The griffins also have a series of special abilities that you wouldn’t find in a normal lion or eagle such as the power to resort one’s sight, the ability to prolong one’s life, and several aerial attacks. The Griffin or Griffins(plural) were known to be myths but who could say if they are if so, many people could believe in one thing, then wouldn’t it also be capable to believe it was once standing on the very soil of which we call home?
